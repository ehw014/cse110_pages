> “There are two ways to get enough. One is to continue to accumulate more and more. The other is to desire less.”  - G.K. Chesterton

I've spent most of my life in Dallas, Texas, and came out west for college. I love animals, travelling, and cooking. To me, the most important thing is to live **simply** and **without regret**.

For travel, my top 3 favorite places I visited are:
1. Taipei
2. Amsterdam
3. Geneva

Somethings I've cooked (relatively) recently:

## Programming

```
while(!isDead) {
    eat();
    //sleep();
    code();
}
```

I first got interested in programming when I was working a desk job at a patio furniture warehouse over the summer. I was responsible for transposing invoice information and inventory counts from our systems to our partner websites (overstock, Sam's Club). The work was extremely monotonous and repetitive. I learned I could get our invoice data straight from the company SQL server and that our partner websites could be navigated automatically by code that looked at their website layout (Javascript elements, CSS tags). I combined all this knowledge in a Python script so I could take a 2 hour lunch.

I view programming as a way to simplify one's life.
